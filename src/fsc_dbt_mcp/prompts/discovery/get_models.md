Retrieves a list of dbt models with optional filtering by schema or medallion level (bronze/silver/gold). Combines functionality of get_all_models and get_gold_models in one tool. Supports filtering by specific schema names (e.g., 'core', 'defi', 'nft') or medallion architecture levels. Defaults to 'core' schema when no filters are provided. Perfect for exploring the model structure and finding models within specific data layers or business domains.
